# PyTeamcenter

## ClientX 

This is an implementation of the Siemens Teamcenter ClientX .NET example in Python.

This has been used extensively with Teamcenter 12.0, so must be tested with later versions.

This has been used to access Teamcenter data using the SOAP interface and also using the Pythonnet (https://github.com/pythonnet/pythonnet) package which allows using the Teamcenter .NET libraries.

## Other Folders

These are all auto-translations of the original .NET examples that ship with Teamcenter.  None has been tested.
